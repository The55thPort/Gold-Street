So I have an idea for how to make more scalable code: object swapping.

Take the venture cards where you roll a specific number on your next turn. We *could* have an if statement in obj_dice to check if that's the current venture number, but that's not scalable at all. Instead, we could have a child object specifically to handle these scenarios and swap out the two objects when the card is drawn.

I got that to work on my version, alongside a bunch of other venture cards I made before we decided to start over. Check ventures 65 and 66 in the code for the dice roll cards.

There are definitely other places we could use this if we plan for it.
